# TS2068_3Slot_Extender
Three slot extender for the TS2068
This extender board is a 3 slot device that is similar to the 4 slot extender. The board is three slots because some users were concerned that the four slot board was too long and made their setup too deep.

Some of the jumper headers have been replaced with slide switches to allow for easier configuration.

The ts2068ExtenderWideV7.zip file contains the full CircuitStudio project.
The ExtenderV7.zip file contains only the files required for fabrication (Gerbers, drill and BOM).
